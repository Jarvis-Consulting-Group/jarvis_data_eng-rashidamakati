**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-rashidamakati/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux cluster monitoring tool using bash scripts that run on the system to collect hardware specifications and data usage for Linux clusters. The system runs on installation on a node to collect their hardware specification and the system usage data is collected using Crontab which is stored in the PSQL database using the Docker container. The code is maintained in a central repository like Github and uses Git for version control of the code.
